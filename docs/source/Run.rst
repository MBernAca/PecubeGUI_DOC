Create a new Pecube project
---------------------------

To create and run a new Pecube project, go to *New input file* or press *Crtl+N* (‘3’, see :doc:`introduction`),
a widow pops up and ask you to provide the name of the new project (Figure 2). After clicking the “Ok” button (Figure 2),
you will be able to provide and set all the Pecube input parameters for your project.

  **Figure 2.** Enter a new project name. This window shows up when clicking on the "New input file" action.


The window should look like the Figure 3. On the top left, you could find and access all the projects you have loaded into the interface,
and thus navigate through their respective parameters. The right part of the interface will host extra input parameters described in the next sections.
