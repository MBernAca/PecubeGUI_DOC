Run a Pecube model

.. _runPecube:

Create a new Pecube project
---------------------------

To create and run a new Pecube project, go to *New input file* or press *Crtl+N* (*3*, see introduction),
a widow pops up and ask you to provide the name of the new project (Figure *2*). After clicking the “Ok” button (Figure 2),
you will be able to provide and set all the Pecube input parameters for your project.
  
.. figure:: ../images/New_Project.png

  *Figure 2. Enter a new project name. This window shows up when clicking on the "New input file" action.*


The window should look like the Figure *3*. On the top left, you could find and access all the projects you have loaded into the interface,
and thus navigate through their respective parameters. The right part of the interface will host extra input parameters described in the next sections.

  *Figure 3. Tab to set up the input parameters for Pecube. On the top left, you can check the name of your project (here: ‘PeGUI’)*
  
  
  The input parameters are presented by categories as referenced in the Pecube’s user guide. All the parameters are sorted in *9* categories: *Topography*, *Time evolution*, *Thermal*, *Data*, *Tectonic*, *Output*, *Isostasy*, *Inversion*, and *Miscellaneous* parameters. For more details on the meaning of each input parameter please refer to the Pecube’s user guide. However, you could access to a short description of each parameter by simply flying the mouse cursor over the parameter labels. After one second a text should appears describing the parameter.
  
In the following, I provide a description of all the tabs, and how to provide the input parameters in PecubeGUI. For a detail description of the parameters, please refer to the Pecube user guide.
