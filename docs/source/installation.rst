.. important::
  In the current version, you need to keep the *Pecube* directory where it is installed by the installation process. In a later version, you will able to move the Pecube directory to another location in you computer. Thus, the next time you will open PecubeGUI, it will simply ask you to locate the Pecube directory at its new location. This functionality will enable the user to dowload and update PecubeGUI without erasing the *Pecube* directory where all the Pecube projects are stored.
