Introduction
============

  Let's start here with a quick introduction of the interface.

  When opening PecubeGUI, a window will show up with a welcome message (Figure 1). This is the main window where you can access all the functionalities. Here, I give a brief overview of the access.

The numbers on Figure 1 give access to the followings:

1. File menu. This menu comprises three options:
- New Input file: open a new Pecube project from which to set new input parameters.
- Open…: open an old input file and load the input parameters
- Exit: quit PecubeGUI. \nAll these actions can be called with keyboard shortcuts, found next to the action labels.
2. Edit menu. Here you can access some preferences for the GUI:
  o Preferences:
      .	GUI theme: ‘Dark’ or ‘White’. Default is ‘Dark’.
      . Show Console: allows to show a console when running Pecube, that shows some Pecube running outputs (see Figure 10).
3. ‘New input file’. Open a new Pecube project.
4. ‘Open Pecube file’. Open an old Pecube input file.
5. ‘show output’. Switch to the graphic area, to plot 2D or 3D data.
