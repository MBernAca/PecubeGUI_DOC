After downloading the PecubeGUI_installer.exe file, clicking on it will start an installation process. You just have to follow the instructions and PecubeGUI will be installed on your local machine.


.. important::
  In the current version, you need to let the *Pecube* directory where it is installed by the installation process. In a later version, you will able to move the Pecube directory to another location in you computer. Thus, the next time you will open PecubeGUI, it will simply ask you to locate the Pecube directory at its new location. This functionality will enable the user to dowload and update PecubeGUI without erasing the *Pecube* directory where all the Pecube projects are stored.
