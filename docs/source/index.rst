Welcome to PecubeGUI's documentation!
=====================================

**PecubeGUI** is a graphical user interface for Pecube designed to help the Pecube's users
to provide their input parameters. PecubeGUI also offers extended options enabling to check the input topography, fault geometry, and geotherm. Latest diffusion kinetic models for
apatite and zircon (U-Th)/He thermochronometry are also included.
Finally, PecubeGUI is specifically designed to plot model predictions coming from Pecube's output files (see documentation).

PecubeGUI is distributed under a GNU license that allows anyone to make modifications and share, as long as the 
distribution has the same license. However, for the sake of having an official and single version, if you provide any changes and
wish to distribute your version, please contact us so that we can integrate your changes in the official version.
