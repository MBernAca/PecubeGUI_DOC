Welcome to PecubeGUI's documentation!
=====================================

**PecubeGUI** is a graphical user interface for Pecube designed to help the Pecube's users
to provide the input parameters. PecubeGUI also offers extended options such as the ability
to make age predictions for the (U-Th)/He on apatite thermochronometer at specific locations.
The interface is also designed to facilitate the pre-run check of the provided topographic evolution
scenario and the steady-state geotherm. Finally, PecubeGUI is specifically designed to plot data 
coming from Pecube's output files (see documentation).

PecubeGUI is distributed under a GNU license that allows anyone to make modifications and share, as long as the 
distribution has the same license. However, for the sake of having an official and single version, if you provide any changes and
wish to distribute your version, please contact us so that we can integrate your changes in the official version that is hosted
in the Github repository.
