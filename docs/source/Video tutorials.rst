Introduction to PecubeGUI

Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qV0mREVm2E

| In this video, I broadly introduce the interface using a preset Pecube project. I go through the input parameters tabs and show several of the functionalities of PecubeGUI such as the visualization of the topography, Fault geometry, and 1D geotherm. In a second part, I show how to quickly plot the model results.
